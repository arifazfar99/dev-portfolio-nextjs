          <p>
            A frontend developer passionate about crafting intuitive,
            responsive, and modern web experiences. I thrive on turning ideas
            into clean, accessible, and scalable code.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            I began my journey as a frontend developer in 2022 and have since
            been continuously learning and growing with modern tools like
            React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I am passionate about design
            systems, performance optimization, and crafting exceptional user
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, I have started exploring backend technologies such as
            Node.js and Express, along with integrating AI capabilities. I am
            currently deepening my understanding of databases, APIs,
            authentication, authorization, and server-side logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            My end goal is to become a well-rounded fullstack developer. I am
            driven by the vision of building complete, scalable applications
            from the ground up, bridging the gap between beautiful frontends and
            powerful backends.

            both mobile and PC games with my friends.
